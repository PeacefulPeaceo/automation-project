    "The project really sounded simple when I read the beginning part of the question until I got to the input handling part and I was like, how will I be able to create a list using an input method, like is it even a thing in python. Well my adventurous self began to think and boom the split method came to me. It was tough since split gives string values until I remembered my list comprehension and used it to convert the strings into floats and then it gave me the result I wanted. Then again I felt it this can be done really there will be other ways and then the thought of using .values() in dictionary also came in and it was a tough one to figure out as it required a lot of techniques from using for loop to create the dictionary to getting the values. \n",
    "\n",
    "After fews days I thought of using the append method to add the values to the list and when I tried it out, it worked and felt much easier than the other method although I was very happy I had to pass through th stress a I gained some knowledge while trying to figure out what to do.\n",
    "\n",
    "Basically my biggest challenge was creating a list using input method\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Just when I thought it was over, I started testing the programa and then I realized that the try and except was not catchng the error effectively. Most times when errors occur at a later time, the user will need to start from the beginning to input values again and the program shuts out also. I had to intoduce while loop to keep the program running until the right input is made. Well figuring out a way to use while loop and check for input that is not a numeric value was the next big challenge i encountered and even google couldn't save the situation. So I thought if it returns true then it can return false so I set it to false and then it worked. Well it was a tough one but it later became a success."
